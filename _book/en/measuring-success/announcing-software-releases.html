<p>One of any open source project&apos;s functions is releasing software with the goal of reaching as many users as possible. To help projects succeed, you&apos;ll need to ensure that you distribute news of your release in a timely fashion, to the widest relevant audience, and with the right information.</p>
<p>Following some basic guidelines for coordinating release announcements can ensure that your excellent work doesn&apos;t get lost in the shuffle. Remember that these are only guides; you community&apos;s practices may differ.</p>
<h2 id="general-guidelines">General guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not set any release date for a Friday or significant holiday. The ideal release date for maximum coverage is Tuesday.</li>
<li>If at all possible, coordinate major releases with relevant conferences and events.</li>
<li>Tailor release announcements and blogs to encourage both <em>use</em> of the software as well as <em>contributions</em> to it.</li>
<li>Talk about how a project benefits the user; explain benefits rather than focusing on technical details.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="track-release-candidate-and-final-release-for-major-point-release-x0">Track: Release candidate and final release for major point release X.0</h2>

</li>
<li><p>Two weeks from release date:</p>
<p>a.  Generate a changelog outlining notable changes to the release that will need to be documented and included within the main changelog file.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-press-releaserelease-announcement">Writing a press release/release announcement</h2>
<p>Writing and distributing a release announcement would seem relatively straightforward; however, some strategies for doing this work are more effective than others. Specifically, you should write your release announcement in a way that makes it most likely for a media outlet to pick it up.</p>
<p>Below is a template for a release announcement, with some guidelines. Please note that this is only a guide; copying exactly what&apos;s here may not be effective for your project.</p>
<p>Be direct and factual about information you share in public statements. Avoid hyperbole (&quot;the bestest project ever made!!!&quot;) and speculation (&quot;the only project that can do this&quot;). Media outlets rapidly disregard such hyperbole and might avoid spreading the word about your release altogether.</p>
<p>Release announcements are not opportunities to hype your project (as tempting as using them for this purpose may be). You can and should take the opportunity to thank your hard-working community. This gives credit to those who&apos;ve done the work and emphasizes the free and open source nature of the project.</p>
<p>Be clear and concise. Support your claims with facts. This will help get your announcement more broadly disseminated.</p>
