== Introduction

The previous chapter discussed participants' motivations for joining and contributing to an open source project.
Any number of forces may compel someone to participate in an open source project.
Some may be extrinsic (like promise of monetary compensation for their contributions) while others may be intrinsic (like an altruistic desire to contribute to community-developed software).
Whatever the nature of these motivations, community managers and architects need to understand them—because when they do, they can tap them to incentivize valueable forms of participation in their open source projects, and can architect their projects to encourage the forms of contribution they most wish to see.
In this chapter, we'll discuss various models and mechanisms for encouraging, incentivizing, and rewarding the kinds of behavior most helpful to a thriving open source project and community.

== Understanding a project's reward models

Strategies for acknowledging and honoring various contributions to an open source project are called that project's "reward models."
The more reward models your project constructs, the better it can engage participants with differing motivations for contributing.
Everyone contributes to projects different reasons, and the most popular projects are those that make contributors feel rewarded, valued, and respected for their contributions—whatever form they happen to take.
Generating those feelings in contributors is a great way to build your project's reputation as a rewarding, welcoming place.

In what remains of this chapter, we'll outline some of the more popular reward models open source projects use today.
As each of these models aims to connect with a certain set of motivations participants may have for contributing to a project, we'll elaborate situations in which a particular model might be most useful.

=== Points and badge systems

Using point systems, badges, and leaderboards to chart and publicly identify contributions rewards participants by visualizing the magnitude of their contributions.
This is a great option for connecting with people who tend to value opportunities to show off their technical prowess a bit.

- GitHub already does this

=== Swag and community-branded items

Giving contributors various items signifying their affiliation with the community—shirts, hats, keychains, etc.—allows  participants to feel a sense of connection with the project.
This is a great option for connecting with people who see community participation as central to their identities, as a fundamental part of their identity-building work.
It allows them to "show off" their connection with the community when interacting with others and makes membership in that community part of their identities.

=== Community awards

Allowing community members to recognize and reward others among them helps communities develop shared identities and social bonds.
This is a great option for connecting with people who see community participation as a way to form bonds with others, to feel connected to a group and to feel united by a common sense of purpose.
Allowing community members to reward one another allows them to continually identify and reinforce shared, communal values and identities.

=== Community spotlights

Running blog posts or video series to spotlight contributors rewards participants by helping them grow their personal brands and their professional networks.
This is a great option for connecting with people who see community participation as an opportunity to gain visibility, maybe even find future work or employment opportunities.

=== Community designations

{Access to new community roles, rights, and access privileges.}

=== Sponsorships

{Sponsored travel and/or attendance at community and industry events.}
