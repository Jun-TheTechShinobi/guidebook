# guidebook
Guidebook of open source community management best practices; is somewhat opinionated.

This repository is the source code and content for The Open Source Way 2.0, which is a refresh of an existing guide on open source community management best practices.

For the 2.0 refresh, we have defined a set of roles and responsibilities around an initial, core group of contributors most familiar with the goals of the project. Beyond that, we'll evolve with the participation of new contributors.

* Project Lead Karsten Wade is responsible for providing vision and leadership to evolve from his original 1.0 work
* Lead Editor Brian Proffitt is responsible for leading a team of editors to work with multiple authors and content sources toward a cohesive, highly readable guide
* Lead Writer Shaun McCance is responsible for working directly with writers to shape their content into the level, style, and narrative of the overall guide
* Editing team: Brian Proffitt, Karsten Wade, Shaun McCance ...
* Writing team: Bryan Berenshausen, Brian Proffitt, Karsten Wade, Shaun McCance ...
