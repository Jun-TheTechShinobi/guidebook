# Guidebook

This repository contains source materials for The Open Source Way 2.0, a (somewhat opinionated) guidebook for anyone interested in managing open source communities. It collects best practices for initiating, nurturing, growing, and maintaining groups of passionate contributors.

The Open Source Way 2.0 refreshes [pre-existing materials](https://www.theopensourceway.org/) on these topics.

## Getting started

This project uses AsciiDoc and a git-based workflow. We track editorial, technical, governance, and marketing discussions on [their respective project boards](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/projects).

Each chapter is an .adoc file that is associated with an issue. These issues are tracked on the [editorial board](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/projects/1). The chapter contains its own outline, content, and lexicon.

Each section is an .adoc file that contains the outline of chapters for that section. Each section has one or more chapters in it. There is not an issue associated with a section, unless a new section is being created.

Want to get involved?

Come talk with us on [the mailing list](https://lists.theopensourceway.org/admin/lists/contrib.theopensourceway.org/) and see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to make your first contribution.

### Workflow

1. Look through the outline to pick one or more chapters you are interested in writing.
   - You may find some source or seed material already contributed into that chapter from existing content being rolled into this projct as the upstream. You can use that content to start, fill-out, or complete a chapter; or for modification or inspiration if it does not fit as-is.
   - There is also source and inspiration in the [1.0 guide](https://theopensourceway.org/wiki).
1. Look on the [editorial board](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/projects/1) to find the corresponding issue for the chapter.
1. Comment on the issue, expressing your interest and what you are thinking of writing about. If you are ready, propose an outline for your chapter.
1. If you need more guidance on what should be in the outline, work with the [lead writer](https://github.com/shaunix) as well as any other interested commentors.
   - You may find some existing content to see/work from in that chapter, and the original authors of that content may have additional insights for you.
1. Once your outline is accepted, begin to write on your chapter as per the schedule.
1. In the editorial board, the card for your chapter(s) will be moved between columns depending on who is responsible for working with it. Once you are ready for an editorial review, it will be shifted over in columns as that happens until the chapter is complete and ready for publication.
  

## Community architecture

For the 2.0 refresh, we've defined a set of roles and responsibilities around an initial, core group of contributors most familiar with the goals of the project. Beyond that, we'll evolve with the participation of new contributors and update [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to reflect current contribution guidelines.

At the moment:

* Project Lead Karsten Wade (@quaid) is responsible for providing vision and leadership to evolve from his original 1.0 work
* Lead Editor Brian Proffitt (@bproffitt) is responsible for leading a team of editors to work with multiple authors and content sources toward a cohesive, highly readable guide
* Lead Writer Shaun McCance (@shaunix) is responsible for working directly with writers to shape their content into the level, style, and narrative of the overall guide
* Editing team (Brian Proffitt, Karsten Wade, Shaun McCance) is responsible for polishing and integrating submissions to ensure consistency of quality and voice
* Writing team (Bryan Behrenshausen (@semioticrobotic), Brian Proffitt, Karsten Wade, Shaun McCance) is responsible for composing, collecting, and otherwise curating materials included in the guidebook.
