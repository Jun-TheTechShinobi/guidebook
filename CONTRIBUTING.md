1. Comment on the issue, expressing your interest and what you are thinking of writing about. If you are ready, propose an outline for your chapter.
1. If you need more guidance on what should be in the outline, work with the [lead writer](https://github.com/shaunix) as well as any other interested commentors.

- Refer to the project [style guide](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/blob/master/STYLE.adoc) (updated regularly) for pointersâ€”but don't let small details slow you down. An editor will help you polish your work before it's finished.

Editorial leads will move the card for your chapter(s) between columns on the [editorial project board](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/projects/1). Once you're ready for an editorial review, post another note in the same issue, and we'll work on moving your card along our editorial process.
- Examine [the chapter file](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook) that corresponds to the chapter you've identified. You may find some source or seed material someone has already contributed into that chapter. Feel free to use that material; build on it to start, fill out, or complete a chapter. Or simply use it inspiration if it doesn't fit your vision. You can also consult the [1.0 guide](https://theopensourceway.org/wiki) for similar inspiration.
- Fork the project repository and adding material on a topic of your choice to its respective chapter. Then submit a pull request outlining your changes so an editor can review what you've added and work with you to polish it.
- Alternatively, propose edits to a guidebook chapter directly in your browser. Select a file in [the project repository](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook) by clicking on it. Locate and click the [pencil icon](https://octicons.github.com/icon/pencil/) at the top of every file in the repository. Make chages to the file in your browser, then submit that file for review.
