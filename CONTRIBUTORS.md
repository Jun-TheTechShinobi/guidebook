## Comprehensive contributors list

This is a comprehensive list of contributors and organizational affiliation, where available and as preferred.
The first purpose of this list is to keep track of the many wonderful people who have contributed to this effort.
A secondary purpose is to help us keep track of _organizational diversity_, meaning we are gathering data as part of following our own best practice of having a community that is diverse from all vectors.
